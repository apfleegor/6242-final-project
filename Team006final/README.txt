DESCRIPTION
Achieving academic success is a top priority for both students and institutions in the dynamic world of higher education. 
It is an intricate puzzle of selecting the right courses at the right time, considering prerequisites, course difficulty, 
and course professors. Making these decisions can be overwhelming, and students often seek answers to questions like, 
"Which combination of Georgia Tech (GT) classes and professors will yield the best and worst GPAs for my chosen courses?". 
Our project "OptiDule", aims to address these concerns by providing students with a powerful tool that enables them to 
discover the ideal combination of classes and professors that will maximize their GPAs, while also offering a tailored, 
optimal course schedule.

This README file will provide a quick guide into understanding, installing, and using OptiDule. Additionally, it is important
to understand the purpose of the remaining files in the deliverable:

The DOC folder
- contains the Final Report (team006report.pdf), a descriptive and thorough dive into the motivation, experimentation, and decisions that led
  to the completed OptiDule
- also contains the Final Poster (team006poster.pdf), a visual guide to the understanding the content of the 
  Final Report quickly

The CODE folder
- this contains all code required to install and run OptiDule:
  * app.py - launches Flask and "index.html", the main file containing the structural dashboard code.
  * optimize_final.py - the optimizing script
  * static folder - holds important javascript and css files:
